# About Waku
Waku is a suite of generalised messaging protocols aiming to be the communication standard for the decentralised web. It enables private and secure human-to-human, machine-to-machine, and human-to-machine communication without reliance on centralised intermediaries. Messaging through Waku is possible from one-to-one to many-to-many.

Waku serves as the communications layer of the Logos tech stack. Alongside the trustless agreement layer, Nomos, and the storage layer, Codex, it is one of the Logos Collective's foundational projects.
